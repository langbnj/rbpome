## Contents

**analyses**: R scripts used to perform analyses and produce figures (mentioned in the folder names)

**include**: Perl utility functions and R MySQL connection functions

**mysql_tables**: MySQL table structures (CREATE statements)

**pipeline**: Perl scripts used to produce various figures (see "Note" within folders)

**scripts**: Additional utility Perl scripts

For the Perl scripts, first run "download.pl" to download datasets, followed by "run.pl", the main script in each folder.

## Note

Please do not hesitate to contact us for assistance with these scripts â€” they have grown historically as this analysis grew far bigger than originally envisioned and aren't polished, though hopefully the comments make it possible to follow them. Thank you!
