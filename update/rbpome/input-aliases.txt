# Alias definitions

# NOTE - The filtering criterion for getting rid of the mutants and fragments in the "clean" master table is whether the mapped-to symbols contain an underscore ("_"). So make sure they contain one.

# Note: All of these get converted to upper case by the scripts.
# I'm going to follow UniProt, not HGNC. HGNC still prefers "C1orf35" over MMTAG2, even though it lists MMTAG2 as a synonym, which is really strange.

# To verify a pair:
# SELECT h.symbol AS human_symbol, UPPER(m.marker_symbol) AS mouse_symbol FROM hgnc h, mgi m WHERE m.marker_symbol='Kifc3' AND h.mgd_id=m.mgi_accession_id LIMIT 1000000;

# >> I think we should drop human AGO2 (called EIF2C2 in the original table) from the master table and analysis since it's actually a fragment, it just wasn't labelled as such. There is no alternative shorter isoform in human or mouse that it could be, either. It seems to be a fragment.

# Similar situation: The mouse protein is 420 aa long, but the human sequence we have is much shorter at 301 aa.

# This one is not in homologene, but that's okay. It has a complicated history and doesn't seem orthologous to any mouse gene.
# From UniProt https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q15695:
# Could be the product of a pseudogene. Appears to have arisen by retrotransposition of ZRSR2. Its uncertain if ZRSR2P1 is the ortholog of mouse ZRSR1, synteny is not conserved.
# Anyway, the only ZRSR genes we have in the screen are ZRSR1=ZRSR2P1 and ZRSR2 from human, so no orthologs no matter what I call it. Human ZRSR2P1 gets its best BLAST match to mouse Zrsr2.
